/**
 * The application frame.
 *
 * This replaces the arrangement the console shipped with, which was a 1200px
 * card centred inside the landing page's own scroll container, between a
 * marketing header and a marketing footer. That is the right shape for a
 * *picture* of the product — the landing page still uses it — and the wrong
 * shape for the product: the page scrolled, the file tree scrolled again
 * inside a fixed 432px box, and on a wide display the app occupied a strip in
 * the middle of an empty screen.
 *
 * Here the browser window is the window. Four regions, each owning its own
 * scroll, and a document that never moves.
 *
 * ## Two real surfaces, not one plus a fallback
 *
 * The same codebase serves a browser and a phone, and both are the product. On
 * a wide window this is a desktop application — three columns at once, a
 * resizable explorer, a status bar, a right-click menu and a keyboard chord for
 * every operation. On a phone it is a phone application — the editor owns the
 * screen, the rail and the tree come in as sheets over it, and the verbs sit on
 * a bottom toolbar within thumb reach, which is where Obsidian mobile puts them
 * and where a thumb can actually reach.
 *
 * Neither is derived from the other. What is shared is the layer underneath:
 * the menu items, the drop rules, the tab model and the ranking are one
 * implementation each, so an operation cannot be available on one surface and
 * quietly missing on the other. Only the presentation forks — and where it
 * forks it does so on purpose, because a 44pt row is wrong under a pointer and
 * a 24px row is unusable under a thumb.
 *
 * Which regions exist at a given width is decided by `frame.ts`, as a pure
 * function with tests, because the combinations that are wrong (a drawer *and*
 * a column, a bottom bar on a desktop, a drawer that survives a rotation into a
 * layout with no drawer) are exactly the ones nobody catches by resizing a
 * browser.
 *
 * ## Slots, not knowledge
 *
 * `AppFrame` knows about geometry and nothing else. It takes the rail, the
 * explorer and the editor as nodes and never imports the console's data, which
 * is what lets it be mounted in a test — and, later, around a pane that is not
 * Browse — without dragging a Convex subscription in behind it.

   * block at the foot of the rail sheet, which is where every application puts
   * it and where nothing on a phone can reach any more — so it comes out to the
   * one corner of the glass that is always visible.
   *
   * **It is the only thing pinned at this edge, and it used to have the
   * contexts beside it.** They were a `contextStrip` slot here: a row of pills
   * in the floating bar, lying over the note. Two things were wrong with that
   * and both were reported from a phone. The bar floats, so the document ran
   * *behind* the pills — a line of body text sliding under a row of chrome,
   * permanently, with no scroll position that clears it. And the strip named
   * the current context one line above a breadcrumb that named it again, so a
   * 390pt screen spent two of its rows saying `@seyi`.
   *
   * The contexts are navigation, so they went to the navigation: they are the
   * first row of `features/console/NavBand.tsx`, inside the scroller, above the
   * path. They scroll away with the document and come back by scrolling up,
   * which is what the person asking for this described. What is left here is
   * the identity and the trailing capsule — Obsidian's own shape for this bar.
   *
   * This slot stays pinned for the reason it always was: it holds the
   * product's only sign-out, and a control you have to scroll to find is one
   * somebody concludes is missing. That is the argument `ConsoleRail` makes
   * about pinning the account block above a scrolling list.
   *
   * `layout.accountAvatar` is the *mark* the geometry is budgeted against and
   * `layout.minTouchTarget` is the pressable around it; the frame imposes
   * neither, because what goes in here is the caller's. On a phone this slot
   * holds the product's only sign-out, so the caller pads to the floor — see
   * `ConsoleRail.AccountBlock`.

   * surface: its own floating object in the top row, ahead of the trailing
   * capsule and pushed to the trailing side with it.
   *
   * Its own slot rather than a child of `topTrailing`, because the capsule is
   * a row of 44pt icon targets that meet (`topTrailCompact`'s `gap: 0`) and
   * this is words. It renders nothing at a pointer density whatever is passed,
   * for the reason `tabs` is refused at compact: the strip says it there, and a
   * contract that lived only in the caller is one a caller can break. What goes
