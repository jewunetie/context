/**
 * Where the console's folder lists read their notes: this device's copy of
 * one workspace, at the clearance its role gives — `useDeviceSearch`'s rule.
 * `undefined` for a role with no clearance, and the lists stay as source.
 *
 * A list redraws whenever the mirror commits a new listing of the workspace or
 * new bodies for it, which is how "it updates as notes change" is kept without
 * a second channel.
 *
 * An owner or editor can also change a listed note's status or owner from the
 * list: `setProperty` reads the note from the bucket, changes that one line and
 * writes it back against the version read, then puts the note it wrote back
 * into this device's copy so the list — and the next reload — reads what was
 * saved. `folderListSource` carries the whole road; this hook only hands it
 * the Convex actions. A folder page may ask for the note to be created
 * (`create`), for a folder whose first property has nowhere to go yet.
 *
 * An owner is picked, never typed: `searchOwners` asks the control plane for
 * the workspace's people and connected agents matching what was typed.
