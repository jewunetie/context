    WHAT THIS CONTEXT IS TO THE PERSON READING IT — ONE BAND, ANSWERED ONCE.

    Browse is the pane where an absence is invisible: a folder the owner keeps
    private does not appear in the tree, so somebody reading a short list has no
    way to tell a small context from a filtered one. That is why a sentence
    exists here at all, and why it is drawn wherever you are rather than only
    where nothing is open — a team link opens straight into a note, so the
    reader with the least context was the one nobody told.

    What that argument never licensed is the screen it produced: two permanent
    full-width bands, stacked, above every note of a context somebody visits
    daily, under a `team level only` chip already saying the same thing. The
    fact is a *status* and the status has a home — the chip, on every route of
    this context, with `tierExplanation` on the members card for anybody who
    wonders what it means. A band is for what this reader has not been told yet,
    so it is shown until it is answered and the answer is written down per
    context. `contextIntro.ts` holds both halves of that argument.

    Once per screen, still: this is the only place it is built, and it reaches a
    note through `notices` and a folder through the page scroller — the two
    branches at the foot of this file, never both.

    `null` for an owner, and `null` while the role is still loading — by
    construction in `tierSentence` rather than by a check here; see its comment.

    orientation somebody is finished with. Nothing is written down for it and

    AND A PHONE KEEPS ITS LINE, BECAUSE A PHONE HAS NO CHIP.

    The whole argument for answering this band is that the fact it states does
    not go anywhere: `team level only` is on the chip, on every route. That is
    true at a pointer width and **false at `compact`** — `TierChip` has one call
    site, `topTrailing={phone ? <note actions> : <TierChip …>}`, and `phone`
    there is this same `densityFor(width) === "compact"`. At a phone's width the
    frame draws no chip, so answering the band would leave a `member` reading a
    filtered listing with nothing on screen saying things are missing from it.

    This is the second time that has been reached. The comment this block
    replaced recorded the first — *"a safeguard asserted in a comment and
    missing from the screen is worse than none, because it stops anybody
    looking for the real one"* — about the same chip and the same density.

    Drawn without a control rather than with one that does nothing: a `Got it`
    that comes back on the next load reads as broken. The phone still gains
    #719's real win, which was one band instead of two stacked.

    The other fix is to give the phone a chip. That is a change to what the
    phone's trailing capsule holds, which the layout argues at length is
    spoken for by the note's own actions — a design decision rather than this
    one, and the conservative half is here.

    MOVES INTO ANOTHER CONTEXT, WHICH FINISH AFTER THE PRESS THAT STARTED THEM.

    Every other operation reports itself by the tree changing while somebody
    watches. This one can still be running minutes later, in a scheduled action
    on a server, with nothing on this device involved — so it gets a line here,
    in the band that already holds "something is happening and it is yours to
    know about".

    Dismissal is per move and only for a finished one (see
    `contextMoveNotices`), and it is written down: a finished row stays
    listable for a day, so a set that lived only here meant the same line on
    every launch until it aged out — a Dismiss button that worked until you
    closed the app. The durable half is `dismissContextMove`; this set is what
