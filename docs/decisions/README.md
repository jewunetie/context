# Durable decisions

Things that were argued through once and should not be silently reversed. Each
names what a "simplification" of it would actually cost, and most name the
test that fails if it is reversed.

These lived in `CLAUDE.md` until the file passed 2,700 lines. They moved here
verbatim; nothing was summarised away. `CLAUDE.md` stays short enough to be
read every session and links here. **Read the file covering the area you are
touching before you change behaviour in it**, and add to it when a durable
decision lands.

Code comments and tests across the repo cite these by title — `see CLAUDE.md,
"A guard nobody has checked is not a guard"`. The titles are unchanged, so
those citations still resolve; look for them here rather than in `CLAUDE.md`.

## [Storage, credentials, and the control plane](./storage-and-credentials.md)

- The gateway is a Cloudflare Worker, not Convex
- Credential retrieval takes two independent proofs
- Never cache a decrypted credential across requests
- Scheduling is not calling
- Credential barriers are enumerated, never inferred
- The credential graph follows imports, and refuses what it cannot follow
- The setup credential is not a stored credential
- Staff is an environment allowlist, never a column
- Platform credentials seal to a scope, customers' seal to a workspace
- Anything needed before this table can be read cannot live in it
- Usage is counted, never logged
- Version history is the customer's object versioning, not a copy we keep
- Managed storage: a bucket we run, in an account that holds nothing else
- One managed account per deployment, never shared
- A migration pass is walked in waves, and an unchanged object is read twice
- The migration's outcome is recorded, because an offer nobody can answer is a nag
- Absent meant two things, and the bucket is asked which
- A bucket born on the layout has nothing to migrate, and is not asked to
- A move between two contexts is three calls, not one function holding two keys
- The model key is a fourth credential route, not a fifth sibling on the binding
- A moved note leaves a forwarding address, and it is a trail rather than an index
- A live editing room holds note text, and the enumeration does not list it
- Note text is read by a model in flight, and nothing of it is kept
- Every use of Jev goes through Jev smarts

## [Customer-owned collaboration](./collaboration.md)

- Markdown and essential editing history stay in customer storage
- One Yjs merge implementation for people, agents, and offline devices
- Live delivery is independent of saving
- Permissions, stable identity, and verification are release gates
- A live connection recovers on its own, and only the control plane says no

## [Premium, Stripe, and the promise money may not touch](./billing.md)

- A plan belongs to a workspace, never to a person
- Two entitlements, one price
- What a plan may never decide
- Three values, three different places, and the split is load-bearing
- The checkout is two round trips, and it cannot be one
- The workspace is never read out of an event
- The signature is the whole security of the webhook
- The API version pins outbound calls and nothing else
- A third route factory, and why it is enumerated separately
- Storage we run is offered wherever a context is made, personal or shared
- What is deliberately not built
- The free managed tier

## [Identity, grants, invitations, and ingestion](./identity-and-access.md)

- Ingestion is on the apex, which makes the reserved-name list a security control
- Mail lands in a personal context and nowhere else
- The privacy tier is a scope on the grant, never an inference from a role
- A first-party signed shell may have its own grant approved by the session hosting it
- A third-party OAuth callback carries a secret the browser kept, not just `state`
- The same derived-subjects shape closes a teardown gap, not just a binding gap
- One connection reaches every context its person belongs to
- One context is pinned for everybody, and the pin is reach rather than membership
- A grant is one person's tooling, and the refusal follows the listing
- An invitation is addressed to a string, and its token is stored in the clear
- An invitation is delivered, and the delivery is scheduled rather than sent
- There is no get-invitation-by-token query, and there must not be one
- The sign-in link's life is `SIGNIN_CODE_TTL_MS`, and never `magicLink.maxAge`
- The two onboarding gates ask two different questions
- …and a third question nobody was asking: how do you get one?
- The hook is a capture-only OAuth client, and that is the whole design
- A workspace's name can be given back, and only its owner can give it
- The covered-context set is a reach, not an identity

## [Privacy, visibility, and sharing](./privacy-and-sharing.md)

- Link previews reveal nothing about a context
- A share link's preview may carry a title; nothing else's may
- A folder link may also name two or three things inside it
- An unlisted share is the third audience, and it is one row rather than a tier
- `privacy.md` is generated, and the console can generate a fresh one
- The visibility tier is displayed, never stored
- The audit trail's `details` are allow-listed
- A row's paths are the reader's own clearance, or the reader's own hands
- A privacy decision is folded, and the fold only ever narrows
- A shared workspace scaffolds `team`, and that is not a widening
- `index.md` is opened by name, because no folder rule reaches the root
- Restricting a folder to *some* of a workspace is not built, and the shape it would take
- Domain-based membership is not built, and would be an invitation, never a grant
- A note carried into another context lands at the narrower of the two ends
- A share follows the note, not the path it was minted on
- A short link is a second locator, never a second tier
- A collect link is a write path, and the only one with no account behind it
- The switch that hands out a write sits under the link, and says so
- A custom domain is a third locator, never a wider tier
- Ownership is a TXT record minted per claim, because a CNAME is not proof
- Which workspace a host serves comes from the host alone
- Premium serves the domain, and a lapse deletes nothing
- One-click setup is Domain Connect, signed, and never for a root domain
- A root domain carries Cloudflare's TXT as a third record

## [Per-note encryption](./encryption.md)

- Encryption is confidentiality, and it is not access control
- The threat model, written as a list of names
- What we can still read, and saying so
- The key model: three layers, because two cannot do the job
- A customer-held key is in scope as a design and out of scope as a shipped mode
- The on-bucket format: an encrypted note is still a file at its path
- What search does
- Round-tripping without damaging ciphertext
- Sharing: an unlisted link over an encrypted note is refused
- Rotation: three different things, and they must not be confused
- What a teardown deletes, and what it keeps — OPEN
- Revocation and export: the customer keeps a usable context, or this feature breaks the first non-negotiable
- Encrypted notes are for humans; no AI client reads one
- The KDF, per client
- Bounds on a KDF descriptor, because a bucket is not a trusted input
- What Phase 1 builds, and what it does not
- What Phase 2a adds

## [The MCP gateway: protocol, transport, orientation](./gateway-protocol.md)

- Two MCP eras, two lists, and they must never be merged
- Authority is decided once, never per protocol era
- An absent `Origin` is allowed; `null` is not
- Orientation is the front door, and `index.md` is the part we do not generate
- Recency ranks attention, and automated capture is collapsed, not excluded
- `search` and `fetch` exist because ChatGPT's chats can call nothing else
- The advertised `inputSchema` is enforced, and it is enforced in one place
- Reach is described from the clamp that will decide it, on both surfaces
- The agent's tool list is enforced at the call, and `readOnlyHint` does not decide it
- Presence is a read that happens to be a socket
- Phase 2: the room carries the document, and what that spends
- Agent activity is announced from finished tool calls, never streamed
- A drawing merges by element, and by Excalidraw's own rules
- A new argument reaches a client that a new tool cannot
- [A CLI learns its workspaces from `scope_info`, as data; the metadata names the app](./gateway-protocol/cli-workspaces.md)
- [An agent attaches an image through `write_note`, and the note embeds the workspace copy](./gateway-protocol/agent-images.md)

## [Markdown forms](./forms.md)

- Responses live in a sister file, not on the form's own page
- The block declares the path, never the visibility
- Layout is declared, not derived
- The gateway renders every row, and therefore parses every row
- A `member` may submit, and that is the only write they get
- You can only delete what you can see
- Changing layout under existing responses is a breaking change
- The response file is created by the author, never by the first submission
- A form that does not parse is inert, never half-working
- Forms need conditional writes, and say so when they cannot have them
- The response table scrolls sideways, and never truncates an answer
- The gateway writes the block too, not only the row
- A form on a share page draws itself, and is the page's one write
- Asking for a link publishes the form, and a refused mint says why
- What is deliberately not built

## [Folder lists](./folder-lists.md)

- Nothing about it is website-specific
- Selection only ever narrows
- A block that does not parse draws its error
- The filter lives in the block
- A project is anything with a status
- A list changes one line of a note, the same way any save does
- A folder page shows its children by status
- A list write is what this device holds afterwards
- Status groups
- An owner is picked, never typed

## [Bucket-backed websites](./websites.md)

- `privacy.md` decides what a website publishes
- An edit is a candidate; the last complete release is the fallback
- Edits wait for Publish
- Every site's pages are kept at the edge per Publish
- A fallback never reverses an explicit restriction
- The index may lag on widening, never on narrowing
- Release bytes stay in the customer's bucket, with one generation of grace
- The workspace icon is the site's favicon
- A page unfurls as itself
- The homepage is `@context-lc`'s website, in its HTML
- A page's emoji travel with the page

## [Search and the derived index](./search.md)

- Search answers from a derived index, and the index is budgeted, filtered, and disposable
- A search reads a ready index, and never builds one
- …and it opens the shards that can answer it, not all of them
- The manifest is the query surface, and the diff moved out from under it
- The console searches through the gateway's search, not a copy of it
- A database we own holds a copy of somebody's notes only where they asked
- A name already taken in our own account is this context's database
- The gateway writes the projection, so the credential rides on the binding
- Progress is reported to the control plane, which owns the row
- The backfill percentage is derived, and inherits the census's owner-only gate
- The switch lives in a context's settings, and the server owns who may throw it
- Corpus statistics are per tenant, which is why it is a database each
- The gateway copies the notes, and a search is what starts it
- …and the control plane runs the same pass for a person who is not there
- …and a search reads it, which for a year it did not
- The descriptor is a sibling of the binding, and the gateway reads it there
- …and the console asks the same projection, through the same answer
- One round trip, and why it cannot be zero
- A blended search over several contexts fuses ranks, and the control plane is where it happens
- A note is the unit of the index, except when it is bundled mail
- The index is sized by the volume it has to hold, and an oversized part sheds rather than taking the rest with it
- A shed index must say so to the caller it happened to, not only to the operator
- With no connection, search reads the copy on the device, and says so

## [The mobile app and the console](./app-and-console.md)

- The note count is measured, stamped, and allowed to be a floor
- One runtime version, pinned, and native deps gated behind it
- The native baseline was chosen once, before the first build
- The iOS editor is the web editor, in a WebView, from a committed bundle
- Every react-native-web `View` is a stacking context, so a `zIndex` is local
- There are two palettes, and a screen may not hold either one
- The web shell is `public/index.html`, because `+html.tsx` is a static-rendering file
- Hue is meaning in this product, so the palette rations it
- Nine sizes, two densities, and no literal font size anywhere
- One interface face, and `display` kept as a role with no face of its own
- A long press has two signals, because the platform is watching the finger too
- An absence is a claim, and a claim needs an answer
- A launch is not a screen, and an empty list is not an empty account
- Offline is a queue and a cache, and a conflict is parked rather than resolved
- A cold start with no network is the case the offline layer was built for
- A reconnection empties every queue, not the one on screen
- The offline mirror is fed by a privacy-filtered manifest, a batched read, and a create that cannot clobber
- Every note on the device: the mirror
- The file tree is drawn from the mirror's metadata, so a folder opens without a request
- Somebody else's change reaches an open tree as a hint per audience, never as the change
- On the web the app has to be able to start offline, which is a service worker
- A team link's note survives the console's own cold start, and the login gate
- A folder page is a page, and a folder is acted on like a note
- A folder's placeholder is not a row
- A phone gets a path bar, which is half of the line that was deleted
- A copy is one press, and it is confirmed outside the modal
- A copy on the device is bounded by who read it, when, and whether the server said no
- Making a workspace is its own flow, not onboarding with a flag
- The first run is two screens, and the rest is a checklist in the console
- Connecting an AI is a guide that checks itself
- An action row is primary first, and the way out sits beside it
- Two name fields for a shared workspace, one for a personal one
- The layout presets are business-shaped, and PARA is not the default
- A new workspace is asked for its image
- Invitations are queued, and a partial send keeps its successes
- The rail's "New workspace" entry is a verb, and the claim entry is a gap
- The rail is one list, with the personal workspace pinned to the top
- The rail folds into the switcher, and the column it occupied goes to the note
- The workspaces come back as a row at the foot of the tree, not as a column
- One account button at the bottom left replaces the chip and the row
- The URL is a mirror of the open note, and the phone's copy of it is a pointer
- A URL is a context and a note, and half of one is not an instruction
- A note link is a path with a keyword in front, because a scheme has a host
- A reference follows the note it points at, and a link is something you follow
- A web link opens on a click, and only a web scheme opens
- The console autosaves, and the prompt that is left is about a decision
- The breadcrumb is the whole path, and its head is a real way up
- The communications console reads through `FileBrowser`, not a new tool
- A note's anchor is a query parameter, not a URL fragment
- A message body is rendered, never linkified
- A diagram lives in the note, and the browser is the only thing that makes it safe
- A phone gets Recent, because it could never get a second tab
- A connected account is one card, and its consequence is armed
- Reading mode is the whole rule for a block that replaces its own source
- A grid is edited in place, and the unit that reveals is the cell
- A control on a table belongs to the row or the column it acts on
- A note may declare the mode it opens in, and the person still outranks it
- The note is a measured column, and the demo note stopped faking one
- The staff console is shaped for ten customers, and its figures count rows
- A sort number is filing, so the console draws the name and keeps the number
- A folder row says what differs, so `0-inbox` gets no count
- "Move to…" is one dialog, and the other context is a destination rather than a mode
- Settings is seven rows, and a row has to earn its place
- A pasted image is a width in the note and a file in the bucket, and nothing else
- [A remote image is drawn through our proxy, never by the reader's browser](./app-and-console/remote-images.md)
- [Custom emoji are pictures in the bucket, written as `:name:` in the note](./app-and-console/custom-emoji.md)
- A status wears a chip; a band is for what you have not been told
- A workspace can wear a face, and the letter is what it falls back to
- The allowed-sender list stays beside the address it gates
- The tree is drawn from the press, and `privacy.md` is what it may not guess
- What the sidebar can do to a folder, the listing can do to it too
- Nothing is named before it is written, and the phone's `+` is the only key
- A phone can ask its context a question, and could not before
- The feed is a file, and the console is a viewing layer over it
- The room binds to a document it agrees with, and a different note unbinds first
- Several rows are one operation, and a pick is what the keyboard acts on
- No UI ships without a design audit first

## [Meetings](./meetings.md)

- One file per meeting, and `read_meeting` is what that costs
- A meeting note is a note, and `privacy.md` decides it with no bypass
- Nothing joins the call
- A browser records the whole call only if somebody hands it the call
- Transcription is cloud on the paid tier and on-device on the free tier, and that seam is disclosed, not glossed
- The cloud path knows _who_ is asking, opaquely, and the ceiling is the control plane's
- The desktop is an OAuth client of the gateway, and it asks for the tier its meetings are filed at
- A recorder that holds a grant transcribes at the gateway, and the meeting's own record is the ceiling
- Pressing Record is the same yes, and the blocklist sees less of it
- A microphone is never opened for a meeting nothing will transcribe
- A chunk of audio is a whole file, and every recorder cuts on the same clock
- The device is never waiting on the network, and a backlog is dropped rather than kept (amended: kept)
- Audio nobody has transcribed yet is kept on the device
- A client-supplied id is bounded where it enters, not where it lands
- The folder is a setting; the question is not
- The recorder is one interface with two implementations, and nothing above it knows which
- The watch is a remote control, never a recorder
- Detection judgement is a pure function, and the desktop app only collects evidence
- The state table is the client's, and a move it refuses is a client faking one
- `written` is the gateway's word, and a client may never say it
- A meeting route is a reserved name, not somebody's handle
- An ack says whether the write was conflict-safe, because some buckets are not
- Ingestion is idempotent by construction, because losing signal is the normal case
- The human's words are never rewritten, and the generated half is disposable
- A meeting lands at an ordinary path, and nothing about it is namespaced
- The Mac app is signed by a workflow nobody's branch can start, and builds honestly unsigned until then
- What is deliberately not built
- Consent is the customer's, and the product may never make recording invisible
- A `finalizing` session has a deadline, because the gateway does not need one
- Silence is not a transcript, and the engine's own evidence is what says so
- A session that captured nothing is not filed
- A segment id names its own meeting, and both sides check it
- The phone had one barrier where the desktop has four, and both halves are named
- The count is a kind, not a number, and every one of these guards reads an id
- A refusal is shown with the reason the gateway gave for it
- The seventh key became a row in the `+`, and the route it guarded did not move
- A permanent, correct refusal is not the same fact as a transient one, and must not share its sentence
- The engine's own evidence travels to the recorder, because a Worker's log is
  not a place a person can read
- A build is what shipped, not what merged — two "the fix did not work" reports
  were one build
- A resumed meeting is a new part spliced into the note it already has

## [Communications](./communications.md)

- A channel lands in `0-inbox`, and there is no second inbox root
- There are no `YYYY/MM/` folders, and the date is the filename
- The mailbox is a folder because a folder is what `privacy.md` can name
- An address becomes a slug, and a slug is never a name anybody can claim
- A channel-day note is one file, with a fixed frontmatter, and its messages are fenced
- A message anchor is a hash, and it is the only provider id in the bucket
- An oversized day splits by rendered bytes, and the split is a pure function of the day
- A channel-day note is a note, and `privacy.md` decides it with no bypass
- Search must index messages, and today's index cannot
- A firehose is not attention
- Retention: raw MIME is off by default, and attachments are metadata-only
- Contacts: one page per person, and a merge never rewrites history
- The Gmail restricted scope is Google's decision, so v1 runs on fixtures
- The five open decisions, and who settles them
- The forward sync loop: a pull, on a floor of five minutes
- What is deliberately not built
- iMessage reads `chat.db` in place, through the one binary every Mac already has
- The destination rule is shared, so the field can say something before Save

## [The desktop shell](./desktop.md)

- The shell loads the hosted console, and keeps a mirror of the last good load
- Sign-in stays in the page, the grant stays in the main process, and they are not the same credential
- The bridge is a package, it is versioned, and the gateway may never import it
- The main process survives whole; the renderer is what is deleted
- The shell updates itself with `electron-updater`, and never during a meeting
- Step 7 landed: a release, not a draft, and the meeting always wins
- Nothing that can start a recording may come from an origin we did not pin
- The approval happens in the app's own window, and that buys exactly one new address
- And then the approval stopped happening at all, which is the point
- Offline is what the outbox was always for, plus a tray that needs no page
- Step 6 landed: one origin at a time, and a mirror that refuses data
- The order is seven pull requests, and the first one changes nothing by default
- Step 4 landed: the console is what a launch opens, and the panel is one variable away
- The signing keychain belongs to the workflow, not to electron-builder
- What step 3 did not do, and what has since been done about it
- Bridge version 4 adds `imessage`, and it is a status object, never a query surface
- One meeting is one credential, and on a Mac it is the machine's
- The microphone is asked for just-in-time, and never a dialog that points at the wrong place
- What is deliberately not built
- The console reserves the space, the shell places the buttons
- The band's other two payers, and the shell half finally wired
- The band moves into the bar

## [Updating the Mac without shipping a Mac](./desktop-updates.md)

- The binary is a permission envelope, and a code signature does not seal what V8 evaluates later
- The line the signature actually draws, and the seven things on the far side of it
- A missing usage string kills the process, which is why over-declaring is nearly free and under-declaring is permanent
- The one-way door: what goes into the next signed build
- A main bundle is a manifest, a blob and a signature, and the shell decides about all three before it evaluates any of them
- Signing the bundle is the design; the update channel is what is left over
- A bad bundle can brick the app so thoroughly it cannot fetch its own fix
- `electron-updater` stays, and the two version numbers do not merge
- Which bundle a Mac is running has to be a fact, or a rollout is a guess
- Three stages, and the middle one is the only one with a deadline
- What would make this a bad idea, argued as if we were not going to do it
- What is deliberately not built

## [Plugins](./plugins.md)

- A Context plugin is Obsidian's manifest with one extra key, and no bundle
- The switch lives in the bucket, in two lists rather than one
- A switch removes a capability and never a protection
- The switch is enforced twice, because the listing is cached
- The owner authorizes a plugin over their own workspace; the workspace is the wall
- A read cap is about our memory, never about their storage
- What may never be a plugin
- A base class is a load-bearing export, so the dialog was built rather than stubbed
- A member the shim lacks is a limitation, except when it is extended
- And a switch has to actually do something
- A vault copy and a managed install are one plugin, and the duplicate is not created
- One panel, one box, and the registry is still a deliberate press
- What is deliberately not built, for Context plugins
- The bucket is the vault, so compatibility starts as a duty not to break things
- A compatibility verdict is a floor, and the code is shaped to keep it one
- Curation changes the label and never the sandbox
- The refusal is the product, so its wording is a rule and not a preference
- One unreadable plugin costs one verdict, never the report
- The read path cannot be aimed
- [The agent plugin: one folder, three manifests, and an installer that asks each agent what it can do](./plugins/agent-plugin.md)
- The agent plugin: one folder, three manifests, and an installer that asks each agent what it can do
- What is deliberately not built
- Drawings: read the file, describe it, and refuse to write over it
- The guard is the load-bearing half, and describing created the need for it
- Everything degrades to "we could not read it", never to a refusal
- The render is true, not hand-drawn, and that is the trade
- The drawing editor is a page, because a dynamic import is not a lazy chunk
- The page never sees the customer's Markdown
- Fonts are served from our own origin, and that is not a preference
- A drawing is named by its file, never by `# Excalidraw Data`
- A bare `%%` ends a section, and that rule has one definition
- A file that does not exist yet is scaffolded, once, and edited ever after
- The editor is cached by a worker scoped to its own directory
- The message check is an identity check, not an origin check
- A list of what the shim is missing cannot be written by hand
- A base class has to be real, and a real dialog is text in one direction
- The only check that has ever caught a plugin not loading
- What is installed is a different question from what runs, and a cheaper one
- A settings pane is described, never forwarded
- The open note is an editor a plugin can write into, while its work is running
- A press that does nothing is a bug, even when nothing is broken
- A check that reads React state from inside `onEvent` is not a check
- A plugin's `fetch` goes through the grant, and the CSP still denies the frame
- A plugin's suggestions cross the `WebView` bridge, and the guest asks nothing until told there is somebody to ask
- A plugin row answers "is it on"; everything else is one press away
- The section is hidden, the machinery is not

## [Testing and guards](./testing.md)

- A guard nobody has checked is not a guard
- A fake models the platform only where somebody has already been surprised by it
- Two offline claims rest on stores no test in this repository has ever talked to
- A gate that only speaks at release is a gate that speaks too late
- A hand-scan is not a fix for something that has already recurred
- An invisible character in source is a fixture nobody can review
- WebKit in CI proves the JavaScript engine, not the OS gesture recogniser
- A surface no browser can open is a surface no test is looking at
- An unauthenticated probe is not a health check for an authenticated endpoint
- The socket is proven by hand, and CI does not cover it
- One thing an agent writes to a canvas still reaches one screen

## [Vocabulary and the workspace model](./vocabulary-and-workspaces.md)

- Vocabulary
- "Brain" is retired, and stays reserved
- The workspace model (build this now, it's cheap)
- Deliberately not yet

## [This repository is public, and review is self-review](./repository-and-review.md)

- This repository is public and MIT licensed
- Every package this org publishes is `@supa-media/*`, through the framework's pipeline
- No handwritten file over 1,000 lines, and the allowance only shrinks
