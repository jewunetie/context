/**
 * The homepage's workspace, writable, in this tab only.
 *
 * The homepage is there to show how the app is used, so a visitor gets the
 * console's own editing: type in a page, add notes and folders, rename, move,
 * copy and delete them, through the same Explorer and editor the app draws.
 * Every change lands in `localTree`'s in-memory tree and nowhere else — there
 * is no bucket behind it and nothing here calls one — so a reload is the site
 * again. Sharing, visibility and downloads stay off: each is a claim about a
 * real workspace, and this one is not.
 *
 * Until the visitor changes something the tree follows the site, so an edit
 * the owner makes to `website/` still reaches an open homepage. After the
 * first change it is theirs, and the site no longer rewrites it under them.
 *
 * Which page the address names is the shell's business; this keeps, for each
 * note that came from the site, the page it is (`routeOf`), and moves that
 * with the note when it is renamed or moved.
