/**
 * A workspace's own emoji: the name rule, the object each one is stored as,
 * and the `:name:` a note writes to use one. Shared because the control plane
 * stores them and the editor draws them, and the two must agree on every name.
 *
 * ## Where they live
 *
 * In the opaque image store the paste path already writes to, as
 * `emoji-<name>.<ext>`. **The object's name is the whole record**: there is no
 * list file and no table, so the bucket describes itself — an export carries
 * the emoji, and one dropped in by hand (rclone, a restored backup) simply
 * appears. `emoji-` is a namespace in this store and not only a label the way
 * `paste-` is: every member may read any object that starts with it, which is
 * why nothing but the emoji writer ever produces such a leaf (pastes are
 * `paste-`, agent uploads `upload-`, icons `icon-`).
 *
 * ## How a note uses one
 *
 * As `:name:`, the form Slack and GitHub use. Obsidian, a text editor and
 * GitHub then show readable text rather than a broken image link, and the app
 * draws the picture. A standard emoji is written as the character itself.
 * See `docs/decisions/app-and-console/custom-emoji.md`.
