    THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS: WHO HOLDS THEM, AND WHAT THAT COSTS THIS FRAME.

    Inside the desktop shell on macOS the window is frameless with inset
    traffic lights, and something has to keep the console's own content out
    from under them. Two candidates, and the frame picks between them here:

     - **This bar**, at a pointer density. It is exactly the height the
       buttons want (`SHELL_TITLE_BAND_PX` is `layout.topBarHeight`), so it
       pays a leading inset and the root band stands down — which is the whole
       of the change: 45pt of blank strip above the console becomes 45pt of
       note list.
     - **The root band**, otherwise. At compact this bar is absolute,
       transparent and lying over a document that scrolls under it, so buttons
       placed in it would sit on the note; and a console window narrowed past
       `narrowBreakpoint` is that layout on a Mac. `lightsInBarFor` is the
       density half of the rule and `shellLightsLeadPx` the platform half.

    `lightsLeadPx` is therefore non-zero only when all of it holds — a Mac,
    inside the shell, at a density whose bar can carry them — which makes it
    the honest answer to "is this frame holding them", and what the handshake
    publishes.

    "reverting when the traffic lights are gone". The bar still *holds* them
    (the root band must not come back and add a 45pt strip nothing sits in);
    it only stops leaving room for three buttons that are not there.

    are no buttons at all, including an ordinary browser tab.

    The frame is sized in viewport units rather than `flex: 1` (see
    `design/css.ts` for why the unit has to be `dvh`), so a band drawn above
    it does not shorten it the way a flex parent would — it pushed a full
    viewport down by the band instead, and the bottom of the console, which
    is where the context switcher and the sync row live, was off the bottom of

    **A layout effect rather than `useEffect`**, and this is the one place the
    difference is visible: the band is an ancestor, so standing it down is a
    parent re-render driven from a child. React flushes layout effects and the
    renders they schedule before the browser paints — with `useEffect` the
