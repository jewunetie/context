/**
 * What the guide can see for itself, so nobody has to report it.
 *
 * Three facts, all ones the product already records, and no new backend:
 *
 *  - **signed in**: the agent holds a live grant on this workspace
 *    (`grants.listGrants`, matched to the agent by the name it registered).
 *  - **read** and **wrote**: the gateway's agent-activity marks for that agent
 *    (`GET /agent-activity`), since the prompt was copied.
 *
 * "Make it stick" is the one step nothing can observe — we cannot see an
 * agent's own settings — so that step takes the person's word and says so.
 *
 * Pure: every state the guide can be in is a test.
