/**
 * Premium, in a context's settings.
 *
 * ## What this screen is allowed to say about leaving
 *
 * One sentence, in every state, unqualified: taking your notes with you is
 * free, on both plans, and keeps working after a cancellation
 * (`CLAUDE.md`, non-negotiable #1). It is a constant rather than something
 * computed — see `EXPORT_PROMISE` — and it is drawn in the same place whether
 * this context is paying or not. **Nothing here may gate, dim, defer or upsell
 * it.** That is the one change to this file that would look like a feature and
 * be a different product.
 *
 * It is stated as a promise rather than offered as a button because the export
 * and hand-off path is not built yet (`docs/decisions/storage-and-credentials.md`
 * says so in its own last paragraph). A button that did nothing would be worse
 * than a sentence that is true.
 *
 * ## Per context, not per person
 *
 * The subscription hangs off this workspace. That is the first thing
 * the section says, because it is the thing somebody is most likely to get
 * wrong: they will assume upgrading their account upgrades everything they can
 * reach, and it does not.
 *
 * ## Absent rather than disabled
 *
 * Every control comes from `usePremium`, which attaches the mutations only
 * where the server said `canManage`. A member sees the plan and no buttons,
 * and the landing page's demo console sees the same section with nothing
 * behind it — neither is offered a control whose only outcome is a permission
 * error. `premiumControl` is the single place that decides.
