   * Move a row on screen now, and hand back the undo `run` needs.
   *
   * The complaint this answers is in `optimistic.ts`: a rename or a drag used
   * to await `moveEntry` and then a `listFiles` per touched folder before one
   * pixel changed, and for a folder it then collapsed the subtree, because the
   * listings under it were still keyed at a path the bucket no longer had.
   *
   * Three things move together, and they have to be one function or they come
   * apart: the listings, the set of expanded folders, and the selection. The
   * middle one is the whole of "the tree does not collapse" — `expanded` names
   * paths, so a folder renamed without re-keying it is a folder that was open
   * and is now shut.
   *
   * The selection is deliberately *closed* rather than followed when it is
   * inside what moved. Following it means reading the note again at its new
   * path, and `move` has always closed the editor for the folder it was given;
   * a note three levels down is the same event and gets the same answer. An
   * open tab left pointing at a path the bucket no longer has is the bug this
   * replaces, not the behaviour it keeps.
