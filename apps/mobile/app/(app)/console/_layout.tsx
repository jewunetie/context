/**
 * The console, as an application rather than a page.
 *
 * ## What this used to be
 *
 * A `ScrollView` containing a decorative backdrop containing a 1200px centred
 * wrap, with a "Context.lc / Sign out" header above it and a "Free. You bring
 * the bucket · MIT · self-hostable" footer below. That is landing-page
 * furniture, and wrapping a working tool in it produced exactly what it looks
 * like: a card floating in a marketing page, with the file tree scrolling
 * inside a fixed 432px box inside a document that also scrolled.
 *
 * Now the frame owns the viewport and the regions scroll individually. The
 * wordmark and the footer are gone — a header whose only job is to hold a
 * sign-out button is a header you can delete, and the identity moved to the
 * foot of the rail where every application puts it.
 *
 * The landing page still mounts `ConsoleShell` with its fake window chrome,
 * and should: there the console is a *picture* of the product.
 *
 * ## Why the explorer is mounted here and not in the pane
 *
 * The file tree is a region of the frame, not content inside Browse. Mounting
 * it here is what lets it be a resizable column on a desktop and a drawer on a
 * phone without Browse knowing which. It is passed only for routes that have a
 * tree: Map and Connections are app-level panes spanning every context, and
 * `AppFrame` draws no column and no drawer button when the slot is absent.
 *
 * The layout still owns the Convex subscriptions and the URL-is-the-truth rule
 * for which context you are in — both unchanged.
