/**
 * The application frame, mounted for real.
 *
 * `appFrame.test.ts` pins the *rules* — which regions exist at which width —
 * as pure functions. This file checks that the component actually obeys them
 * once react-native-web has turned them into DOM, which is a different claim
 * and the one that has historically been wrong: the console's previous shell
 * looked correct in source and still put the app inside a page that scrolled.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot assert
 *
 * jsdom lays nothing out, so this is a **render test, not a layout test**. It
 * can resolve react-native-web's injected stylesheet, so "the frame is one
 * viewport tall and clips" and "there is a bottom toolbar and no rail" are real
 * assertions. It cannot tell you the drawer is 86% wide or that the editor's
 * measure is comfortable; those were checked in a browser at 390×844, 768×1024
 * and 1440×900, and on the device sizes in the pull request.
 *
 * Every assertion here has been verified to fail with the corresponding rule
 * reverted — see the sabotage runs recorded in the pull request.
 *
 * This module is the shared mounting harness for every file in this folder —
 * it carries no tests of its own. `jest.mock` is per test file, so every file
 * here re-registers it; it happens once more, here, so the `require()`s below
 * (of `AppFrame` and friends) resolve against the mock rather than the real
 * `react-native-safe-area-context`.
