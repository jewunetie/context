/**
 * Transient notices, and the place a completed action goes to be undone.
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * This comment used to open by saying "the console moves files optimistically —
 * the row jumps to its new folder before the bucket has confirmed anything".
 * It does not, and never did: `useFileBrowser`'s own header says the opposite
 * in as many words, because a rename that failed but already moved on screen is
 * a console telling somebody their bucket contains something it does not.
 *
 * The real reason is the plainer one. A move, a rename and an archive all
 * *succeed*, silently and completely, and the console's single `notice` line
 * can only say so — it cannot offer a way back, and "move it back" means
 * finding the file again in a tree it has just left. So the undo is here, on
 * the operations that have an exact inverse, and the notice line keeps the
 * refusals and the failures it is good at.

/**
 * How long a toast stays.
 *
 * Eight seconds, deliberately, and it is the undo that sets the number. The
 * usual two-second toast is tuned for a notice nobody has to act on; as an undo
 * window it is theatre. The sequence after a file move is: notice the row moved,
 * read the toast, decide it was wrong, move the pointer, click. Two seconds does
 * not cover *reading it*, so an undo nobody can catch is the same as no undo,
 * except that we told them there was one.
 *
 * Eight is long enough to read, decide and reach, and short enough that a stack
 * of them does not become furniture. Hovering pauses it, so "I am still reading
 * this" is honoured rather than raced.
