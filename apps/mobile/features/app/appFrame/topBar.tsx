    THE FILE TREE'S OWN TITLE ROW.

    While the tree is a column, the stretch of this bar above it belongs to
    it: exactly the column's width, holding the window's buttons, `‹ ›` and
    the tree's own toggle, so the column reads as running from the top edge
    of the window to its foot rather than starting under a blank strip. The
    owner chose this (2026-09-26) over a column with separate rows for inbox,
    activity and meetings — everything in the column stays a folder or a
    page, and this row is chrome, not a place.

    The rest of the bar — the tabs, the trailing group — then starts where
    the editor starts, so a tab sits over the page it opens.

    Folded, the same controls lead the bar instead, so neither `‹ ›` nor the
    way back to the tree goes away with the column.

        A round drawer toggle at the leading edge pulled the file tree in —

        the panel it had opened — and the switcher chip pulled the rail in

        answers `false` to both toggles at every density now, so what is
        left is not a bar with two buttons and a gap: it is a row of slots,
        and the middle one is a list.

        At medium and wide the console leads with nothing any more: the
        workspace switcher chip moved to the account button at the foot of
        the file tree (see `AppFrame`'s `account`), so its tabs start here.

        THE OPEN NOTES, IN THE TITLE BAR, HANGING FROM ITS FOOT.

        **They were a band of their own between this bar and the note**,
        drawn by `EditorRegion` at the top edge of the editor region — with
        a `surface2` ground, a hairline under it, a right rule between every
        tab and an accent rule over the active one. Three horizontal bands
        stacked down a 900pt window, the middle one saying nothing the
        other two did not.

        Here they are what every browser and every editor with a real title
        bar draws: tabs hanging from the bottom edge of the chrome, with
        the active one filled in the *page's* own surface so it reads as
        the front edge of what is below it. That is why this slot is in
        the frame rather than in the region — the effect is the tab meeting
        the page across the boundary between two surfaces, and a strip
        drawn on the page has no boundary to meet.

        `alignSelf: "flex-end"` on the slot rather than a taller bar: the
        bar keeps `topBarHeight` and the tabs are shorter than it, which is
        what leaves the air above them.

        Compact draws none of this, and **the frame is where that is
        enforced** rather than only where it is described. Tabs are a
        pointer instrument (`TabStrip.tsx`: "there is no mobile half any
        more") and a phone has `RecentSheet` over `history.ts` instead.

        `_layout.tsx` also guards with `!phone`, and that guard is worth
        keeping — it avoids building a strip nothing will draw. But a prop
        whose contract lives only in its callers is a contract one caller
        can break silently, and one did: the visual fixture passed `tabs`
        unconditionally, so a 390pt board came back with a pointer tab
        strip across the top of the phone's note. Nothing failed; it was
        visible only in a screenshot.

        The trailing slot, which on a phone is **the** grouped container.

        Obsidian's top bar is exactly two objects: a rounded-square sidebar
        toggle at the leading edge, and one rounded container at the
        trailing edge holding the actions for what is on screen — the book
        and the ⋯ in the reference. Nothing in the middle. So at compact
        this is a floating capsule with the same surface and shadow the
        toggle has, and whatever `_layout` puts in it sits inside that one
        container rather than bringing a box of its own.

        It used to wrap its chips in a bordered, filled pill *and* let each
        chip draw its own border — three nested rounded boxes for two
        words. The chips themselves are gone from here: identity and the
        storage binding are facts about the context, and they live at the
        foot of the file tree where Obsidian puts the vault switcher.

        At every other density the bar has its own surface and its own
        hairline, the chips have room, and a container around them would be
        a box in a box — so `topTrail` alone, unfilled.

        The trailing group, and search is part of it.

        Search sits in the top bar where there is a pointer and in the
        bottom toolbar where there is a thumb — rendering it in both would
        put the same control twice on the screen with least room. What
        changed is *where* in the bar: it was centred, on its own
        `marginLeft: "auto"`, which put two auto margins in one row and
        split the free space between them — so it sat in the middle of the
        band looking like a browser's omnibox rather than beside the other
        actions. One group, one push to the trailing edge, and the centre
        of the bar is free for what belongs there.

        between them, which would float this in the middle of the glass —
        the mistake the search comment below records once already.
