/**
 * The frame with its slots **filled**, for looking at rather than measuring.
 *
 * ## Why this is a second fixture and not a flag on the first
 *
 * `AppFrameFixture` answers geometry questions — does the peek land where the
 * column was, is the seam a 7pt target, does folding the tree give the editor
 * its width back — and it answers them with stub slots *on purpose*: a slot
 * that shrank to its content would make every width assertion a measurement of
 * the word "rail". `appFrameFold.spec.ts` depends on those stubs and their
 * testIDs, so they stay exactly as they are.
 *
 * This one answers a different question, and it is the question that went
 * unanswered for four merged changes: **does the console look like the design**.
 * Stub slots cannot answer it. A frame whose rail is the word "rail" tells you
 * nothing about whether the rail's rows, its account block, the tree's
 * indentation or the note's measure match the artboards — and "the tests pass"
 * was, four times, reported as though it did.
 *
 * So: the real `SwitcherMenu`, the real `Explorer` and the real `BrowsePane`,
 * on the same fixture data the WebKit suite already ships, inside the real
 * `AppFrame`. Nothing here
 * can reach an account or a bucket; `useE2EFixtureConsoleData` is demo data
 * with three capability flags flipped, and there is no deployment behind it.
 *
 * It is reachable at `/e2e-fixture?screen=app-frame-visual`, under the same
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_E2E_FIXTURE` gate as everything else in this folder — which is
 * inlined at export time, so every shipped build redirects the route to `/` as
 * if it did not exist.
 *
 * ## The corner and the right panel, added 2026-09-19
 *
 * The console's `+` and its Meetings panel shipped in #723 against a mock, and
 * this board could show neither: the `+` is mounted by the console *layout*,
 * which this fixture replaces, and the panel defaults shut. That is the exact
 * failure this file's own header names — a board that cannot answer "does the
 * console look like the design" about the part somebody just changed.
 *
 * So the `+` is drawn here the way the layout draws it, and
 * `?panel=meetings` opens the right panel on a running meeting. The panel is
 * behind a parameter rather than on by default because the artboards draw the
 * console with it closed, and a fixture that changes the resting state is
 * reviewing a screen the design does not have.
 */
/**
 * Two tabs, the second of them active — the shape the design draws.

 * showing a transient state as if it were the resting one.
