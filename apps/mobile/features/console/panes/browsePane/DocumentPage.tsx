/**
 * The page a document in the browse region sits on, for a view that does not
 * draw its own.
 *
 * `BrowsePane` runs the phone's scroll surface full-bleed so a note can keep
 * its own reading margin, which means every other document has to supply one.
 * On a pointer layout the pane pads itself, and the document is centred in the
 * note's measure instead. `FolderView` does both itself (its outer view is also
 * the right-click target, so it keeps its own structure) and takes the two
 * styles below from here, so the margin a folder listing gets and the margin a
 * page wrapped in this gets are one value rather than two that can drift.
 *
 * The Inbox, a channel and a contact page were mounted bare, with neither, and
 * sat on the edge of the glass. A channel's day is not wrapped: it owns its
 * scroller (to scroll to an anchored message) and pads its own page, as a note
 * does, and a wrapper would take the height that scroller needs.
