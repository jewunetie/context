/**
 * The Live Preview editor, on web.
 *
 * A thin, deliberately boring shell around CodeMirror. Everything interesting
 * about how the document is drawn lives in `livePreview.ts` and everything
 * about how the editor behaves lives in `editorSetup.ts` — both pure, both
 * tested, and `editorSetup.ts` shared verbatim with the iOS half, which runs
 * the same configuration inside a `WebView`. This file exists to solve exactly
 * one hard problem, which is keeping a mutable editor instance and React's idea
 * of the world in agreement without either of them fighting the other.
 *
 * ## The two directions, and why they are not symmetrical
 *
 * **Typing → React** is a subscription: `updateListener` fires, and the text
 * goes out through `onChange` into the existing reducer in `editor.ts`. Nothing
 * about the editor's own state changes as a result, so there is no loop.
 *
 * **React → editor** is the dangerous one, and it happens for exactly three
 * reasons: a different note was opened, the person discarded their draft, or a
 * conflict was resolved by loading somebody else's version. In all three the
 * new text is *authoritative* and the editor must be told. What must not happen
 * is the round trip — editor fires `onChange`, parent re-renders with the same
 * text, effect writes it back — because writing a document into CodeMirror
 * resets the selection, so that loop shows up as the caret jumping to the end
 * of the line on every keystroke.
 *
 * The guard is one comparison: only dispatch when the incoming `value` differs
 * from what the editor already holds. That is why `latestValue` exists rather
 * than a dependency array — a dep array compares against the *previous render's*
 * prop, which is not the same question.
 *
 * ## Why not a controlled component
 *
 * The obvious React shape — value in, onChange out, re-render on every
 * keystroke — is wrong for a text editor whose state includes a selection, an
 * undo history and a parsed syntax tree. CodeMirror owns all three. Treating it
 * as controlled would mean rebuilding them from scratch on every character.
