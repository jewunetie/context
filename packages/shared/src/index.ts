 * side of a package boundary is a rule that will drift, and its two copies are
 * then tested separately or not at all.
 *
 * A reusable pipeline's path filters cannot see a cross-package import, so a
 * test that reaches across a boundary is generally skipped on exactly the
 * changes it exists to catch. That is true of `consentScopes.test.ts` and is
 * *not* the reason this particular pair moved: `gateway-contracts.yml` carries
 * no `paths` filter and runs the whole control-plane suite on every pull
 * request into `main`, so both halves were already reached. What was wrong was
 * having two copies at all. `packages/shared/**` being in both the `mobile` and
 * `convex` change filters is what makes this a safe place to put the one copy —
 * see `email.ts` for when that was read and where.
