/**
 * A ```` ```list ```` fence, drawn as the notes it lists.
 *
 * The grammar and the row selection are `apps/mcp/src/lists.js`, imported
 * rather than reimplemented, for the reason `../formBlock.ts` gives about
 * forms: two grammars drift, and the drift shows up as a list that draws here
 * and not on a shared page. See `docs/decisions/folder-lists.md`.
 *
 * ## When the list is drawn rather than shown as source
 *
 * Whenever the caret is not in it — the rule `htmlPreviews` follows, and not
 * the one forms follow. A form is drawn only in read mode because filling it
 * in means putting a caret inside it; a list has nothing to type into, so it
 * can give its source back the moment the caret arrives, like a diagram does.
 *
 * And only where a surface configured a host (`listHost`). Without one there is
 * nowhere to read notes from, and an honest code block beats a list that can
 * only ever say "nothing here".
