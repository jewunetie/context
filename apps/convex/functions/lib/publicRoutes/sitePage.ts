/**
 * `/site/revision` and `/site/page`: what the router needs to keep a copy of
 * a website's pages at the edge, one copy per Publish.
 *
 * Every site's pages wait for Publish (`docs/decisions/websites.md`), so
 * between two Publishes the answer for an address does not change unless a
 * restriction lands, and a restriction moves the revision too. The router asks
 * `/site/revision` on each visit (one database read) and asks `/site/page`
 * only when it holds no copy for that revision, which is the one request that
 * reads the customer's bucket.
 *
 * Registered in `http.ts`; this module registers nothing. Both answer as an
 * anonymous visitor would be answered, whatever arrived with the request: a
 * copy kept at the edge is handed to anyone who asks, so it can only ever be
 * what anyone may see. A signed-in visitor asks Convex directly.
