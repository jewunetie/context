/**
 * The title, card and folder contents for a readable team link, or nothing.
 *
 * `[null, null, []]` on every failure — no CONVEX_ORIGIN, a non-200, a body
 * that is not JSON, a timeout, a thrown fetch — and `previewForNote(null)`
 * renders GENERIC_PREVIEW byte for byte. So an unlinked note, a revoked link
 * and a control plane mid-deploy are one answer, which is what keeps the probe
 * to "which notes has the owner published a card for".
 *
 * The third element is **only ever a decoration on a card that already has a
 * title.** It is passed through untouched here and bounded inside
 * `previewForNote`, which is also where a falsy title short-circuits to the
 * frozen card — so a control plane that answered with children and no title
 * publishes nothing at all.
 *
 * POST, like every route it talks to: a GET would put a handle and a note path
 * in this Worker's outbound URL and from there into logs.

/**
 * The title a short link unfurls with, or `null`.
 *
 * `noteTitle`'s shape, one field narrower, and the narrowness is the point:
 * `/share/short` returns no card token, so there is nothing here that could
 * assemble a per-share image out of a capability. Every failure — an origin
 * that is not configured, a timeout, a non-200, a body that is not what this
 * documents — is `null`, which renders the generic card.
 */
/**
 * A short link's title and the version of its card, or two nulls.
 *
 * A pair rather than a title, for the reason `noteTitle` beside it returns a
 * triple: the card is addressed by the name this function was already given,
 * so the only thing missing was a cache-buster — and that comes back
 * pre-computed because a folder card draws names this route does not
 * disclose. See `previewForShortLink`.
