/**
 * HTTP routes.
 *
 * Three families live here: the auth framework's own callbacks, the ten
 * control-plane routes the MCP gateway resolves every request through, and the
 * three ingest routes the Cloudflare Email Worker calls.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE GATEWAY ROUTES
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * `apps/mcp/src/controlPlane.js` is the normative contract — request shapes,
 * response shapes, and the reasoning. `apps/mcp/test/controlPlaneStub.mjs` is
 * an executable reference implementation of it. These routes must be
 * behaviourally indistinguishable from that stub. If they and it disagree, one
 * of them is a bug and it is probably this file.
 *
 * Four properties are load-bearing, and each of them is easy to lose in a
 * refactor that looks like a tidy-up:
 *
 * 1. **The gateway secret is necessary and never sufficient.** Every route
 *    below is built by `gatewayRoute`, which refuses anything that does not
 *    carry it — that is proof #1, "this caller is the gateway". It authorizes
 *    *nothing else*. `/gateway/binding` additionally requires the end user's
 *    access token and derives the workspace from the grant that token resolves
 *    to; `expectedWorkspaceId` can only veto, never select. A leaked gateway
 *    secret on its own must yield no credential, no session, and no
 *    enumeration.
 *
 * 2. **Presented tokens arrive verbatim and are hashed here, on arrival.** An
 *    access token, a refresh token, a revocation token, and an authorization
 *    code all reach these routes in the clear over TLS and are turned into a
 *    SHA-256 digest before they touch anything else. Nothing downstream ever
 *    receives a raw token. Tokens the gateway *minted* arrive already hashed,
 *    because only the client needs the plaintext. That asymmetry is what makes
 *    a dump of `oauthGrants` inert.
 *
 * 3. **Every negative is the same negative.** `{ "session": null }`,
 *    `{ "binding": null }`, and `{ "authorization": null }` are built in one
 *    place each and are byte-identical across every reason they can occur.
 *    Distinguishing "not yours" from "does not exist" turns a route into an
 *    oracle for the customer list.
 *
 * 4. **No route returns more than one workspace's anything.** There is no call
 *    shape here that lists, searches, or enumerates. Bulk extraction is meant
 *    to be impossible because the surface has no shape for it, not because
 *    nobody has tried.
 *
 *    `/gateway/usage` is the one route whose *request* names several
 *    workspaces, and it is not an exception to this: it returns a count of
 *    rows written and nothing else. Naming a context there cannot read it,
 *    confirm it exists, or distinguish a real id from an invented one — every
 *    input is answered identically.
 *
 * The handlers behind these routes are in `functions/lib/gatewayRoutes/`,
 * grouped by what they answer. Each route is still declared here, built by
 * its factory, and registered at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * `__tests__/structure.test.ts` reads this file and enforces (1) structurally,
 * along with the rule that only an enumerated route may reach a decrypted
 * storage credential.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE INGEST ROUTES
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * `infra/email-worker/src/controlPlane.ts` is the normative contract, and
 * `functions/ingestionGateway.ts` holds the reasoning for what they may do.
 * Three things about them are worth stating here, where the routes are:
 *
 * 1. **A different secret.** They are built by `emailWorkerRoute`, not
 *    `gatewayRoute`, and the two secrets do not substitute for one another. A
 *    stolen email-worker secret must not become a working MCP gateway.
 *
 * 2. **They relax the two-proof rule, and that is a decision, not an
 *    oversight.** An inbound email carries no user access token — nobody is
 *    present and nothing was authorized just now — so proof #2 cannot exist in
 *    the form `/gateway/binding` uses. What is kept is its important half:
 *    `/gateway/ingest/resolve` takes a *name a sender typed* and mints a ticket
 *    for whatever that name resolved to; `/gateway/ingest/binding` takes only
 *    that ticket. No field in either request can name a context, so a holder of
 *    the worker secret has no vocabulary for "give me the shared context
 *    `acme-board`" — and no such context could answer anyway, because mail
 *    lands in a personal context and nowhere else.
 *
 * 3. **`/gateway/ingest/binding` is the second internet-facing path to a
 *    decrypted credential**, and it is enumerated as such in
 *    `__tests__/structure.test.ts`. That file's `CREDENTIAL_HTTP_ROUTES`
 *    comment says a second entry "means a second internet-facing path to other
 *    people's bucket keys". It does. The residual risk is written out in full
 *    in the worker's contract and is bounded by: personal contexts only,
 *    ingestion-enabled owners only, a per-name rate limit on resolve, and a
 *    ticket that expires in five minutes and buys exactly one credential.

 * replaces the bearer check is strictly more than one: the body carries an
 * HMAC-SHA256 over `<timestamp>.<raw body>`, computed with a secret only Stripe
 * and this deployment hold, and the timestamp is both *inside* the MAC and
 * checked against the clock, so a captured delivery is not a standing key.

 * HTTP route able to reach a decrypted credential — a list
 * `__tests__/structure.test.ts` pins at three, each argued for. Same reasoning
 * `RESERVED_SECRET_NAMES` gives about `GATEWAY_SECRET`, and it is in that
 * refusal list for the same reason.
 *
 * **A deployment with no signing secret refuses every delivery.** Not "allows",
 * which would be a free upgrade for anybody who can find this URL, and is
 * exactly the shape of mistake that ships because it makes a staging
 * environment work.
 *
 * The raw body is read once, verified, and only then parsed. Re-serialising a
 * parsed object and hashing that verifies a different document from the one

/**
 * `POST /share/short` — the card for a short link, `/@seyi/intake`.
 *
 * **The fourth unauthenticated route, and the first one added since this list
 * was called "a pin, not an amnesty".** So the argument in full, on its own
 * terms.
 *
 * *Why it cannot be a field on one of the other three.* `/share/note` takes a
 * handle and a note path; this takes a handle and a name that is not a path
 * and does not resolve like one. Folding them together would mean one route
 * whose second argument means two things depending on a flag, and the failure
 * that list exists to prevent is exactly a field nobody looked at reaching an
 * anonymous crawler.
 *
 * *Why it may answer at all, when `/@seyi` may not.* The same hinge
 * `/share/note` turns on: the probe space is names the **owner** chose. There
 * is no list of likely slugs — a slug exists only where somebody typed one —
 * and `shortLinkSlugRejection` refuses every name this product writes, so the
 * guessable ones cannot be claimed in the first place. What a prober learns is
 * the title of something its owner deliberately published at a memorable
 * address, which is the feature.
 *
 * *What it costs, stated.* Anyone holding or guessing the URL learns the title
 * without signing in, and a card that has already unfurled is cached by the
 * platform that unfurled it and cannot be recalled. Content still needs the
 * live share; revocation is enforced at the destination, where it is immediate.
 *
 * *One field, and never the token.* `/share/note` returns a `cardToken`
 * because a team link's token is a locator — its reader is authorised by
 * membership on every request. A short link may sit over an `anyone` share,
 * where the token **is** the authorization, so handing it to whoever guessed
 * the name would be a capability outliving the name it was published at. This
 * route therefore returns the title alone, and a short link unfurls with the
 * product's own image rather than a per-share card.
 *
 * Always 200, always `{ "title": string | null }`. Every absence — unknown
 * handle, unclaimed name, released, revoked, expired, title switched off — is
 * that shape with `null`.

 *
 * What was wrong was the conclusion. The image does not have to be addressed by
 * the token — it can be addressed by the handle and slug the crawler already
 * used to ask for the title. The token stays where it was, nothing new is
 * disclosed (the picture says the note's name, which `/share/short` already
 * answers with), and a link somebody reads off a card unfurls like every other
 * link this product mints.
 *
 * Its argument is guessable, like `/share/note`'s and unlike the two token
 * routes', so it is bounded the same way: it answers only for a slug the owner
 * deliberately claimed on an `anyone` link, and a slug nobody claimed is
 * byte-identical to one that does not exist.
