/**
 * WHAT A CLICK IN THE TITLE BAR DOES, WHEN THE BAR IS THE WINDOW'S HANDLE.
 *
 * On the web `-webkit-app-region` means nothing and these are inert; inside
 * the desktop shell the bar is `drag`, so the window moves with the pointer —
 * and a control inside it would move the window instead of activating, which
 * is the one rule `docs/decisions/desktop.md` warned this change would need
 * and the reason it was not smuggled into the change that added the band.
 *
 * **`no-drag` goes on the frame's own slots, never on the controls a route
 * passes into them.** A route can put anything in `switcher`, `tabs`,
 * `topTrailing`, `accountSlot` or `syncSlot`; if the guard lived on those, it
 * would hold for exactly the controls somebody remembered, and the next chip
 * added to the trailing group would drag the window with no diff that looks
 * wrong on its own. On the slot it is structural: whatever is handed in is
 * inside a region that has already opted out.
 *
 * Each slot hugs its content, which is what makes that safe — `topTabs` is
 * `alignSelf: "flex-end"` and only as tall as the tabs hanging from the bar's
 * foot, so the air above them stays the bar's, and draggable. What is left to
 * grab: that air, the gaps between slots, and the run between the chip and
 * the tabs.
 *
 * Asserted through the injected stylesheet in `shellTitleBand.test.ts` —
 * jsdom drops the declaration from the CSSOM, so `getComputedStyle` cannot
 * see it, the same way it cannot see `dvh`.

    border because `navToggleCompact` "already draws a shadowed white capsule
