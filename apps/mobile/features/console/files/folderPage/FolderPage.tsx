/**
 * A folder page's head and body, around the file listing `FolderView` draws.
 *
 * Every folder page can be seen three ways — **Files**, the listing as it has
 * always been; **List**, its folders and notes grouped by status; **Board**,
 * the same groups as columns — switched by three words on the title's row and
 * remembered per viewer, per folder (`viewMemory.ts`). A folder opens in List
 * once anything in it has a status, and in Files otherwise.
 *
 * Any folder or note in it becomes a tracked item by getting a status: a
 * note's goes in its own frontmatter, a folder's in its front note, and a
 * folder with none gets an `overview.md` holding just that. The page itself
 * is one too — a project folder is titled by its front note and says its
 * status, owner and first paragraph under the title (`Head.tsx`).
 *
 * Nothing new is stored and nothing is read that a list block could not read:
 * the notes are the device's copy at the role's clearance, and every change is
 * one frontmatter line written against the version read. Without a host —
 * no device copy for this role, or a surface that passes none — the page is
 * the Files listing exactly as before, with no switch to offer.
