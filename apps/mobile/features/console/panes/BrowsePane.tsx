/**
 * Browse — the note, and nothing between you and it.
 *
 * The tab strip is *not* here. It is chrome belonging to the editor region, so
 * the layout draws it above this pane — which also keeps one tab state in the
 * app rather than one per pane that mounts.
 *
 * ## What this pane used to be
 *
 * The whole file editor: a 246px tree beside the note, a "New note / New
 * folder" toolbar above the tree, a pane heading with a paragraph explaining
 * what markdown is, and — above every document — a card header carrying the
 * file name, two chips and a byte count, and beneath *that* a row of seven
 * buttons: Rename, Move, Duplicate, Copy, Cut, Archive, Delete…
 *
 * All of it is gone, and every operation still exists. The tree became a region
 * of the frame (`files/Explorer.tsx`); the buttons became the row's own
 * right-click menu and long-press sheet; the card header became a one-line
 * breadcrumb at the top of the region.
 *
 * On a phone even that line has gone, because Obsidian spends nothing on it:
 * the note names itself with an inline title inside the document, its
 * visibility is a Properties row, and Share is in the top bar's trailing
 * group. What is left at that density is one full-bleed scroll surface with
 * the document on it and the chrome floating over both ends. A pointer layout
 * keeps the tab strip and the breadcrumb — there the line is a region header
 * that also carries folder navigation, which an inline title cannot.
 *
 * ## Why the note is no longer in a card
 *
 * A bordered, rounded, inset card is right for a *widget on a page* and wrong
 * for the primary surface of an application. It cost 16px of padding, a border
 * and a radius on all four sides of the thing people actually came to read, and
 * it drew a boundary around the one element that should extend to the edges of
 * its region. The editor now fills what it is given.

        The breadcrumb is drawn for a selected *folder* too, not only a note —
        **and only on a pointer layout.**

        It used to be `kind === "file"` only, and `FolderView` prints the
        folder's own name with no path — so two folders called `notes` were the
        same screen, and there was nowhere that said which one you were in. That
        matters beyond orientation: the toolbar's `+` writes into the selected
        folder, and this line is what names it.

        ## Why a phone has none

        Obsidian on iOS has no breadcrumb, and that is not an omission: the note
        names itself with an inline title at the top of its own text, and a full
        path pinned *above* the document is a second band of chrome under a bar
        that is already floating there — the two rows this branch exists to
        collapse into one — costing the note its first screen.

        So at `compact` the three things this row carried have each gone
        somewhere they belong rather than being deleted: the note's name is the
        inline title inside the document (`NoteEditor`), the visibility chip is
        a Properties row (also `NoteEditor` — `visibility:` is filing metadata),
        and Share is in the top bar's trailing group (`_layout`, where Obsidian
        puts the ⋯ container).

        **The fourth thing it carried was folder navigation, and this used to
        hand that to "the tree", which a phone no longer has.** It is `pathBar`
        below — the same `Breadcrumb` in `pathOnly` mode, drawn *inside* the
        note rather than pinned over it, so it scrolls away with the document —
        plus `FolderView`, which is what a segment of it opens. That is not the
        row this branch removed: it is one line of monospace path with no title,
        no chip and no Share on it, and it is the only way up on a density with
        no panel.

        The dialog is pinned to the note it names, and to the capability that
        opened it, because neither of those holds still while it is on screen.

        `<Slot/>` in `app/(app)/console/_layout.tsx` reconciles this pane by
        component type with **no `key`**, so `sharing` survives
        `/console/@a` → `/console/@b` — the same mechanism `Explorer.tsx`
        documents for its own callbacks. Left unchecked, the dialog stayed open
        across a context switch still titled after the old context's note, and
        submitting called the *new* context's `share` with the *old* context's
        path. `createShare` checks `requireWorkspaceRole(owner)` and the path's
        syntax, never that the path exists in that workspace — so under PARA
        conventions, where `1-projects/plan.md` plausibly exists in both, the
        owner grants a recipient read access to a note they did not aim at.

        `files.canShare` is re-checked for the reason the button reads it
        inline: it is `canEdit && isOwner`, so it moves independently, and this
        codebase treats a control that is present and refused as the defect
        rather than the refusal.

        It closes the keyboard route as a side effect, and that is worth
        knowing rather than rediscovering. `BrowsePane` reports no
        `onOverlayChange`, so `scopeForFocus` answers `global` with this dialog
        open and every GLOBAL binding in `keymap.ts` still fires behind it —
        ⌘K can change the selection under the dialog. Pinned to the selection,
        the dialog closes rather than acting on a stale path. The missing
        overlay channel is filed separately; this is not a substitute for it.

        `!selected.readOnly` is an **equivalent mutant** today and is kept
        anyway: dropping it fails nothing, because the button that sets
        `sharing` already requires it and `readOnly` is `key === PRIVACY_KEY`,
        so a note cannot acquire it while staying the selected one. It mirrors
        the button rather than reasoning from what `readOnly` happens to mean,
        and it stops being equivalent the day anything else is read-only. Said
        plainly because "sabotaging it fails nothing" is otherwise indis-
        tinguishable from an untested guard, which is what this file's
        neighbours keep turning out to be.
