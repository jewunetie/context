/**
 * Markdown for reading, not for editing.
 *
 * The console's editor draws Markdown by *decorating the source* — see
 * `console/files/livePreview.ts` — because the buffer there is the file and
 * nothing may rewrite it. A shared note is the opposite situation: nobody is
 * editing it, the reader wants a document rather than a source listing, and the
 * text belongs to somebody else.
 *
 * That last part is why this exists at all rather than reusing CodeMirror. This
 * parses **another person's note**, so the questions are what a hostile
 * document can do to the reader:
 *
 *  - **No HTML is ever interpreted.** A note may contain `<script>`, an
 *    `onerror` attribute or an `<iframe>`; every one of them is text. React
 *    Native has no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` equivalent in the components this
 *    renders into, so the risk is not injection into the DOM — it is a renderer
 *    that decides to be clever later. The block type list below is closed, so
 *    "clever" would have to be added on purpose.
 *  - **Every link is checked before it is offered.** `javascript:`, `data:` and
 *    `vbscript:` URLs are dropped to plain text rather than rendered as
 *    something tappable, because a shared note is a document a stranger wrote
 *    and the reader has no reason to expect a link in it to be hostile.
 *  - **Nothing is fetched.** Images are shown as their alt text, not loaded. A
 *    remote image in a shared note is a tracking pixel that reports every read
 *    to whoever wrote it, and — because a share is addressed to one named
 *    person — that is a read receipt the reader never agreed to.
 *
 * ## Deliberately small
 *
 * Headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, fenced code, tables, thematic breaks,
 * and inline emphasis/code/links. No footnotes, no definition lists, no raw
 * HTML, no math. A shared note that uses something outside this renders as
 * legible text rather than as markup, which is the failure this is willing to
 * have: an unstyled line is readable, and a half-parsed one is not.
