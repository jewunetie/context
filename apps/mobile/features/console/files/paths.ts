/**
 * The digits a name carries so that something will sort it — `1-`, `04-`.
 *
 * PARA only works in order: `1-projects` has to come before `2-areas`, and a
 * bucket listing, Obsidian's sidebar, the Files app and `ls` all sort one way,
 * alphabetically. So the order has to be *in the name*, and every tool that
 * reads the bucket then draws the number back at you on every row, in the one
 * product whose whole claim is that the files stay pleasant to live in.
 *
 * The number is filing, the way `.md` is filing. It is kept on disk, where it
 * does its job, and dropped from the label — which is also why this is
 * backwards compatible in both directions: an existing bucket needs no
 * migration to look better, and a context whose folders are drawn without
 * numbers is still, byte for byte, a context any other tool opens in order.
 *
 * ## What counts as one
 *
 * One or two digits, a hyphen, and something left over that does not start
 * with another digit. Each clause is load-bearing, and each one exists to
 * refuse a name rather than to accept one:
 *
 *  - **One or two digits**, so `2026-09-18.md` — a daily note, which is how a
 *    great many people name a great many notes — keeps its year. Four digits
 *    is a date; one or two is somebody counting folders.
 *  - **Nothing left over, nothing stripped.** `1-` is a name, not a prefix
 *    with a name after it, and a row with no text on it is worse than a row
 *    with a number on it.
 *  - **Not another digit**, so `12-25-christmas.md` is left alone rather than
 *    drawn as `25-christmas`, which reads as a bug. A second number after the
 *    hyphen means the first one is probably a month, not an ordinal.
 *  - **Not a dot**, because `1-.hidden` would be drawn as a name this product
 *    reserves (see `describeNameProblem`) for a file it is not.
 *
 * The bias in all four is the same and it is deliberate: **when in doubt, draw
 * what is on disk.** Showing a number nobody wanted is untidy; hiding half of
 * a date is a lie about the customer's own file.
 *
 * Only a hyphen separates. `1 projects`, `1.projects` and `1_projects` are
 * names, not prefixes — a rule that guesses at every punctuation mark somebody
 * might have typed is a rule that eventually eats a name somebody meant.
 *
 * All four clauses are narrower than `titleFromPath`'s
 * `/^\d+[-_.\s]+/` in `functions/lib/shareTitle.ts`, which has dropped the same
 * prefix since share cards existed — deliberately, because the two are doing
 * different jobs. That one *invents a title* and is allowed to refuse ("a card
 * with no title is honest"); this one *draws the customer's own file back at
 * them*, beside the Rename that spells it out, so being wrong is not a missing
 * card but a row naming a file that is not the one on disk.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * **It does not look at the siblings.** `1-plan` and `2-plan` in one folder
 * both draw as `plan`, and that is the accepted cost of a rule a single name
 * can be evaluated against — the alternative is a label that depends on what
 * else happens to be loaded, so the same folder reads differently in the tree,
 * the tab strip and the breadcrumb. Two folders deliberately given the same
 * word are a naming problem the person can see and fix; Rename, Move and the
 * palette all still spell the number out.

 * of noise repeated down the whole tree, and on a phone they are four
 * characters taken from the name when the row ellipsises.
 *
 * `1-projects` is drawn as `projects` for the same reason and by the same

 * `SORT_PREFIX` above is where that rule is stated and bounded.
 *
 * **This is display only, and the distinction is load-bearing.** The name on
 * disk never changes: `TreeRow.name` and `TreeRow.path` still carry the real
 * one, every operation addresses the file by `path`, and Rename prefills from
 * `baseName` rather than from this. A stripper that leaked into a write would
 * rename `foo.md` to `foo` in somebody's bucket, and `privacy.md`'s exact-note
 * rules only address `.md` paths — so the note would silently lose its own
 * visibility on the way past. The number is worse still: dropping `1-` from a
 * write renames `1-projects` to `projects`, which moves every note inside it,
 * breaks every `[[1-projects/…]]` link pointing at them, and re-sorts the
 * context — a folder, its subtree and its share links, for a cosmetic rule.
 *
 * Only `.md` is stripped, and only when something is left. An attachment keeps
 * its extension — `.png` on a row is information, because it is the one thing
 * distinguishing it from the note beside it — and a file literally called
 * `.md` keeps its name rather than becoming a blank row.
