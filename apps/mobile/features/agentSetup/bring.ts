/**
 * "Bring over what it knows" — the last setup step, and the connection check.
 *
 * The person picks what to include and copies one prompt. The agent then reads
 * the workspace and writes notes into it, and those reads and writes are what
 * the guide watches for (`checks.ts`), so one paste both fills the workspace
 * and proves the connection works. The prompt always ends with a "Getting
 * started" note, so an agent with nothing in its memory still writes once and
 * the check can still pass.
 *
 * The guardrails are `BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT`'s (`onboarding/agents.ts`): orient
 * first, say where each note goes, write only what is known, never overwrite,
 * never touch index.md or privacy.md. They travel inside the prompt because it
 * reaches an agent we do not control.
 *
 * It does not wait for a go, and it asks for everything rather than a sample
 * (owner, 2026-09-26). ChatGPT stopped to ask for confirmation and then wrote
 * five surface-level notes; it took a second prompt to get twenty projects
 * out. The person has already picked the topics on this screen, and the
 * client asks before each write where it needs to, so a second checkpoint in
 * the chat only stalls the step the guide is watching.
