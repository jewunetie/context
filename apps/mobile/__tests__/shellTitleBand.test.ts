/**
 * THE CONSOLE RESERVES THE SPACE FOR THE SHELL'S TRAFFIC LIGHTS.
 *
 * `docs/decisions/desktop.md`, "The console reserves the space", and the
 * orchestrator's decision it records (2026-09-07): the desktop shell's console
 * window is frameless with inset traffic lights, and the hosted page used to
 * draw from `x: 0` — so the close/minimise/zoom buttons sat on top of the
 * console's own top-left content (the active-context chip). The fix is a band
 * only a Mac inside the shell gets: 38px, full width, in the console's own
 * header colour, draggable so the window can still be moved by it.
 *
 * Two files, two kinds of check:
 *
 *  - `shellTitleBand.ts` is the rule, as a pure function of two strings — see
 *    its own header for why it takes `platformOS` and `shellPlatform` rather
 *    than reading `Platform.OS` and a bridge itself.
 *  - `ShellTitleBand.tsx` is the component that reads those two globals and
 *    draws (or does not draw) the strip. Rendered here with the reference fake
 *    shell from `@context/desktop-bridge/fake`, exactly as
 *    `meetingsDesktop.test.ts` does, so a bridge shaped like a real one is
 *    what this suite exercises rather than a hand-rolled guess.
 *
 * ## Sabotage record
 *
 * Run as temporary local edits and reverted. Counts are failing tests in this
 * file.
 *
 *   `shouldShowShellTitleBand` returning `true` for any shell           2
 *   ...dropping the `platformOS !== "web"` guard                        1
 *   `ShellTitleBand` reading `bridge.shell.platform` without `?.`        1
 *   the band's height hard-coded instead of `SHELL_TITLE_BAND_PX`       1
 *   the band losing `WebkitAppRegion: "drag"`                          1
 *   `viewportHeight` ignoring its inset (the clipped footer)             1
 *   `shellTitleBandPx` answering the band's height with no shell         2
