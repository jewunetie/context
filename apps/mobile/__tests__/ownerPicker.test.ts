/**
 * AN OWNER IS PICKED, NEVER TYPED.
 *
 * Reported from a folder's List view: the owner menu offered `Sayo`, `Seyi`,
 * `Seyi Olujide` and "New value…", so one person had three spellings and
 * anybody could type a fourth. An owner is now somebody in the workspace, an
 * agent connected to it, or "any agent", found by a search the server runs —
 * a workspace of a hundred people is not a list to scroll.
 *
 * The properties with teeth: there is nowhere to type a new owner; what is
 * offered is what the search returned; typing asks the server rather than
 * filtering a roster; and an owner already written by hand is kept and shown
 * for what it is, with the member it most likely meant offered first.
