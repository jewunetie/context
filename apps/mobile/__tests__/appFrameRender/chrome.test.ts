 * THE TAB SLOT IS THE POINTER LAYOUT'S, AND THE FRAME SAYS SO ITSELF.
 *
 * Tabs are a pointer instrument — a phone has `RecentSheet` over `history.ts`
 * — and `console/_layout.tsx` has always guarded the slot with `!phone`. That
 * guard is worth keeping, because it avoids building a strip nothing will
 * draw, but it is the *caller's*, and a prop whose contract lives only in its
 * callers is one a caller can break in silence.
 *
 * One did. `AppFrameVisualFixture` passed `tabs` unconditionally, so a 390pt
 * board came back with a pointer tab strip lying across the top of the phone's
 * note. Nothing in the suite failed; it was visible only in a screenshot taken
 * to compare against the design canvas — which is exactly the class of bug
 * this file exists to convert into a failing test.
 *
 * `mountFrame` now passes `tabs` at every width for that reason.

/**
 * THE RIGHT PANEL, ON THE GLASS.
 *
 * `appFrame.test.ts` pins which arm of `Regions.aside` each density answers.
 * This is the half that file explicitly defers to here, plus the two claims
 * that are only true of a rendered tree:
 *
 *  - **the scrim does not cover the file tree.** `Regions.scrim` is one
 *    boolean and cannot say what it lies over, so the region sweep states the
 *    rule as "a column is never the panel a scrim is dismissing" and leaves
 *    "and is not covered by it" to this file. At `medium` the panel is over
 *    the note while the tree keeps its column, and a full-body scrim would
 *    grey out and make inert the region somebody reaches for to leave;
 *  - **the control and the region agree.** A toggle drawn where the command is
 *    a no-op, or a panel with no way to open it, is the pair `frame.ts` spends
 *    a section keeping honest, and neither is visible in a pure function.
 *
 * ## Sabotage record
 *
 * Applied, suite run, named test observed failing, reverted.
 *
 *  1. The scrim's `left` offset removed, so it covers the body.
 *     → **1 fails**: `the scrim spares the file tree beside it`.
 *  2. `asideToggle` dropped to `asideToggleFor(density) !== null`, ignoring
 *     whether a panel was supplied.
 *     → **1 fails**: `a surface with no panel is offered no way to open one`.
 *  3. `toggleAside` written without its `asideToggleFor` guard, so a press at
 *     compact writes `asideOpen`.
 *     → **1 fails**: `pressing at a phone width opens nothing, then or later`.
 *
 *     The test had to grow its second half before this sabotage could fail it,
 *     and that is the finding rather than a detail. Asserting only that the
 *     panel is absent at compact passes with the guard gone — `regionsFor`
 *     refuses to *draw* one there whatever the preference says — so the
 *     written state was wrong and invisible, surfacing on the next resize.
 *     Which is the ⌘B failure exactly: a command writing a field the layout it
 *     was pressed on never reads.
