 *
 * `sharePreview` answers a **link-preview crawler**, which has no session and
 * never will, and it is reached only through `infra/router`. A shared secret
 * would be a fourth credential to rotate for a value the request already
 * carries: the caller presents a share token, 32 bytes from
 * `crypto.getRandomValues` that only the owner and the person they sent it to
 * have seen. `infra/router/src/preview.ts` refuses to forward anything that is
 * not shaped like one, so garbage never reaches this deployment.
 *
 * What makes it safe is not the absence of a secret — it is what the route can
 * say. `previewTitleForToken` returns one field, `title`, and returns `null`
 * for an unknown token, a revoked share, an expired one, and one whose owner
 * turned the title off, so a crawler cannot tell any of them apart. The title
 * itself is owner-chosen or derived from the note's filename and is **never
 * read from the note**, so an unfurl costs the customer's bucket nothing.
 *
 * The tests in `sharePreview.test.ts` are what hold that; the entry here is
 * what stops a second one being added without the same argument.

   * slug the crawler already used to ask for the title, so the image arrives
